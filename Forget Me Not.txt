\b What is it?
\b0 \
-A mobile app that reminds the user when to water their plants\
-Social aspect: discussion boards for plant-related questions and photo feed to share photos of your plants\
-Game-ified to encourage people to keep taking care of their plants\
\

\b Final Project
\b0 \
-It could be fun to code it (and thank you for letting it be just mobile, and not requiring only desktop!) \'97\'a0open to trying to code it all, but\'85\
-Discussion board: can format it in css, but does it have to actually function for you? (Like, will you test a text-input box and then see if the posting mechanism works, etc.)\
-Photo feed: can code \'91mockups\'92 of a photo feed, but how can I make it so you can upload a photo and actually have it appear? I feel like this is out of my realm.\
-Badges. If I were to reward the user for watering their plant on schedule all month\'85 I have no idea how to code it so that it would know when to reward the badge.\
\

\b Overall
\b0 \
Coding would be fun and also a challenge. I feel like I could try if the more complicated things (photo feed and discussion board, in particular) if they were non-functional. However, adding in the actual functions doesn\'92t seem feasible to me.}
